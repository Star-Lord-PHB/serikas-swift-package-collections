# Serika's Swift Package Collections 

A few swift packages collections that I commonly use 

Each folders here contains a Swift Package Collections, which is the `collection.json` file. Add the url of this file to your swift package collections using the following command 

```sh
swift package-collection add <url-to-collection.json>
```
